# React Hooks Lesson

This repo is a sandbox to help teach my fellow Preserve graduates that I've had the chance to work with React hooks. There are plenty of great resources on the web already.
But since we have all gone through the program and I have an idea of what the missing pieces are. Hooks a newer feature and much favored the past couple years, but do to due the timing of the study plan being built this was not taught and resources were limited.
If developing in a team setting and not working on legacy code, it's very likely that you team will not use class components and implement hooks for the features of react that we love.

### Dependencies / About the repo

- Typescript
- React
- Vite
- Tailwindcss

This was bootstrapped with `create-react-app --template typescript` then configured over to use `vite` replacing `react-scripts` for development and build. Learn more [Vite.js here](https://vitejs.dev/) and how to convert your
[CRA to Vite](https://cathalmacdonnacha.com/migrating-from-create-react-app-cra-to-vite) here.

Additionally [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) is added. I highly recommended learning about if you haven't already. Very powerful and simple to setup and use.

Finally there is the Typescript, it may seem like extra setup and work. Trust me, learn it, love it. I think anyone who is going to be a "Javascript Developer" will need to know Typescript.
